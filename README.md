## Abstract
Bread wheat (*Triticum aestivum*) and barley (*Hordeum vulgare*) are major cereal crops, with close evolutionary relationship as a result of a common ancestor 13 million years ago. Having had their genomes recently completed and continuously perfected, only a few studies focuses on comparative transcriptome analyses in the *Triticeae* tribe, most of them applying outdated approaches. Therefore, it is important to establish a semi-automated and reproducible method to incorporate earlier findings into the quickly evolving field of transcriptomics. The inflorescence of grasses is a highly specialized organ of reproduction, whose development is responsible for production of food grains and most of its regulatory pathways still remain unclear. In this research, we investigated each scientific article concerning *Triticeae*, and determined a set of 898 publications inspecting flower development, corresponding to 118 gene subfamilies shared between wheat and barley. Then we repeated the analysis of 455 publicly available RNA-seq samples of barley and wheat to perform combined differential gene expression of several datasets targeting different aspects of flower development. Transcript changes in four developmental or experimental factor contrasts were used to identify significantly different up-, or down-regulated gene-sets, and their corresponding gene subfamilies across barley and wheat subgenomes. By intersecting these differentially expressing genes (DEGs) with results of the text mining, we found 87 shared gene subfamilies, which represents the reliability of text-mining based gene identification and reproducibility of published studies. Our comparative meta-analysis of transcriptomics provides insights for the complexity of investigating inflorescence development in barley and wheat, and how such an integrative approach can be a precedent for future larger scale analyses.
